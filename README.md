# Kinship-Recognition
Automated kinship recognition from face is a relatively recent problem that is
mainly studied by the application of Deep Learning techniques. The problem at
hand is mainly that, given a pair of images, a prediction of whether the people are
related or not, needs to be made. The output is a label whether the people are
related or not.
The objective is achieved through Siamese Neural Networks.
Done as a part of Topics in Deep Learning.
